            <p>
                The establishment of Gunnison in 1862 resulted from the resettlement and merging of two earlier communities, each built up in 1859 along the lower Sanpitch River in upper Gunnison Valley. A group of settlers from Sanpete County had started a village on the south bank of the river at Chalk Hill Point about two miles east of the eventual town. At about the same time, a group of colonists from Springville and other places formed a settlement about three miles west of Chalk Hill. They called the place Kearns Camp after their leader, Mormon Bishop H. H. Kearns. Simple houses were erected at each location, with the intention of creating permanent communities. The impetus for settlement in the area had come from Brigham Young after his tour from Manti to the Sevier Valley and the southern colonies in May 1850. During a return visit in 1862, Young saw the limitations of the swampy area, which was termed "too muddy for a hog's wallow"; he advised the people to move up to the bench area, where a new town was built.
                The town was named in honor of government explorer Captain John Gunnison, who was killed with six of his men by Indians while in the Sevier Valley area in 1853. Edward Fox surveyed the townsite in rectangular eight-acre blocks and James Mellet erected the first house as the pioneers dismantled and carted their earlier structures to the new site in late 1862. They were now a long distance from water, so the first public task was to dig a ditch from the river to the bench-top town. Early settlement efforts were hampered by difficulties with Indians during the Black Hawk War. Although a few settlers died in skirmishes, an unexpected benefit occurred in April 1867 when some of the people evacuated from the Sevier County colonies relocated permanently to Gunnison.

                Construction was facilitated after 1863 by the construction of a vertical "pit-saw" sawmill, followed soon after by a horse-powered circular sawmill. A blacksmith shop was started in 1867 by Lorentz Dastrup. Early structures were erected by stone mason Christ Tollestrup, adobe craftsmen Eric Larsen and Harmon Christensen, and carpenter William Christensen.

                Concurrent with town building was the commencement of farming. A committee divided up the land, drew up rules, and distributed the land to settlers. The first irrigation system was improved and expanded throughout the valley. Irrigation companies were founded and dams, reservoirs, and canals were built.

                The society of Mormon pioneers was formally organized with Joseph S. Horne being sent from Salt Lake City to serve as bishop in 1868.

            While there is not many things to do here in Gunnison that other bigger cities have, like indoor rock climbing, we have local mountains where you can hike, bike and do all things that involve the outdoors. There is Yuba which is about 15 minutes North of Gunnison 
            for swimming, fishing and boating. There are places like the local kids park, with a skate park just on the other side of the park. The swimming pool is right next to the park on the North side of town.</p>
