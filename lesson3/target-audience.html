        She has been waiting to take some pictures in the snow of her friends, a day that is partly and somewhat warm to get some good lighting and so her hands don't freeze holding the camera. 
        She and her friends have been wanting to take a trip to Canada during the winter time to enjoy the nature there and she was looking at what days look the best for those pictures she has been 
        wanting to take. She came to weathersunshine.com to find out what those days would look like. When they got there she was so happy that we were able to help them get those pictures, she ended up 
        emailing us the first day and couldn't believe how beautiful her pictures had turned out, and how accurate our prediction was for that day and couldn't wait to get to taking more the following 3 days.</p>
