        wanting to take. She came to weathersunshine.com to find out what those days would look like. When they got there she was so happy that we were able to help them get those pictures, she ended up 
        emailing us the first day and couldn't believe how beautiful her pictures had turned out, and how accurate our prediction was for that day and couldn't wait to get to taking more the following 3 days.</p>
