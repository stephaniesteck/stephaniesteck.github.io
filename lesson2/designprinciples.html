            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            
            <a class="links" href="www.walmart.com" target="_blank">Walmart</a>
            
            <img src="./images/walmart.jpg" alt="Walmart">
            <p>On the Walmart website shows repetition that is shown here for looking through the different categories. It has the heading which shows 
                items you are looking for, as is shown in the image the two headings are Fall Style & Home and Shop Top Brands. Along with more options 
                that are more descriptive like shoes, fall clean up, etc. 
            </p>

        <div class="columns">
            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <a class="links" href="www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>
            
            <img src="images/pinterest.jpg" alt="pinterest">
            <p>Pinterest shows contrast in the colors of their website, making the background very bright and colorful and then having some food on a white plate
                which brings contrast and interest to the website. It makes it unique, it also show contrast in the size of the text from the heading text to the
                paragraph text which is more descriptive. It also has contrast for the color of the search bar it is more subtle compared to the color of the heading
                and paragraph shown above.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="columns">
            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <a class="links" href="www.target.com" target="_blank">Target</a>
            
            <img src="images/target.jpg" alt="target">
            <p>Target's website shows a rule of thirds in their category options, there are three columns which gives the website the appeal of design, it catches the
                eye of the user, and also makes it easy to find what you are looking for. The columns are also even when it comes to the rule of thirds. It helps the 
                user's eye to scroll down to where it is looking and what they are looking for.
